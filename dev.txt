88	adjudicated	3	We've funnelled about 4k into saving our dog's life. As you can see- we haven't gotten that in donations, but what we've gotten has really saved our asses. I found out my dog had a 'treatable' disease right after graduating from college. The college debt was already a burden, and after my partner got laid off- the panic set in that we would have to put my best friend down. He's too young for this, and has been too good to us.
50	adjudicated	1	Hey guys, how are you? So, I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder for 6 years now, though I know I've had it for more than ten years, I just didn't know it was an anxiety issue. I'm a 30 years old straight dude who started struggling with anxiety when I started to think I was gay (now I know this thing is called HOCD, but at the time I even came out as bisexual to my mother). After I went to therapy hoping to accept my sexuality, I discovered my problem wasn't self acceptance but an anxiety disorder, so that made sense, because I came out as bisexual even though I don't feel attracted to men. I thought I was burying my desires or something like that.
80	adjudicated	1	He broke my hymen through overly aggressive fingering before we ever had sex. He surprised me by trying unlubricated anal sex without warning, and I did fight that one, but only out of complete instinct. I screamed and moved away and sat crying for an hour, unable to move or speak while he tried to apologize. After we broke up he became religious, and he publicly and privately called me a whore and a slut for stealing his virginity. I never defended myself or told anyone about what happened.
258	adjudicated	3	That will never go away. I’ll be right with you cause family comes first and I don’t want Mum and Dad to feel in the middle of it all anymore. Its going to take time. I again left it a few hours, but I felt incredibly annoyed by her reply, which I felt was very dismissive of her own actions. I decided to cut her out.
313	adjudicated	2	I don’t get paid again until 9/1/18. This is the only low cost apartment near my school. What can I do? I’m desperately in need help and it has to be paid. Very comfortable and willing to show proof of security deposit from the leasing portal.
193	adjudicated	3	I know this is a subreddit for domestic violence but I'm feeling really freaked out right now and when he gets aggressive I feel like I cant phone anyone because he hasnt hit me but I'm scared of him because hes really big and mentally unstable. I'm obviously looking to move out but it's hard with full time school in the fall in a really expensive city I'm struggling to find a room that I can cover. Just dont know what to do when I feel unsafe over the possibly next few weeks while I find a place. I also have pets so I cant just leave and not be in the house and I'm worried he might harm them. I also dont know what my parents should do to deal with him because they cant live like that either.
145	adjudicated	3	Long story short my family in NE Ohio is abusive as hell so I had to leave the state and stay with family down south. It isn't working out and they're sending me packing to Ohio because I guess I'm a financial problem even though I got a job here. I have nowhere I can stay. I'm even getting rid of my beloved cat so I can have options. I can't go back to my family in Ohio.
54	adjudicated	3	Im at a point where I need to talk to him about so many things but I cant if he continues to avoid me. I feel like a mess and any advice or help is really appreciated!   --- TL;DR Boyfriend and I have communication issues and he now left for two days and wont respond to any calls or texts. Any one know what I can do to help myself not go crazy and fix these issues.
232	adjudicated	1	I don't post that much so sorry about the formatting! As a preface my mum has always been protective of me. But the main drama started on boxing day (26th December). She misunderstood me and thought I wasn't going to see her before I moved back to University so she locked herself in her room and began to cry. She even told me to pack up my stuff and move to my boyfriend's.
66	adjudicated	1	I stopped eating and stopped sleeping... I eventually ended up in A&E after telling my family I intended to kill my self, I'd already been self harming and pulling out my hair from the stress. I lost a stone and a half in weight in a month. I was given sleeping pills as I had not had the rest to let my brain consider recovery, and I was given lorazepam for the holidays so I could get out of the house to have Christmas with the family. I now only use lorazepam for panic attacks I have at work or situations I cannot leave when I panic , like catching a plane.
462	adjudicated	2	First off I'm male but my relationship with the woman is strictly platonic stemming from professional, we are co-workers. It's no secret to anyone that she's in an abusive relationship as she's come to work several times over the last several months with blackeyes etc and admits to being abused. She been in the relationship for 1.5 years which turned   info is out of the way, here's the new twist that has brought me to split roads. Yesterday she showed me a text from him detailing how angry he'd been at her 12 yr old and that if he didn't have so much will power he would have choked her son to death and that she needs to get her son to behave so he doesn't have to crack his skull. I encouraged her to show that to Leo and have him removed from the apartment as well as get an order of protection, she seemed to be considering that but has expressed fear of retaliation in the past.
26	adjudicated	2	I forgot about it until I noticed one day that I saw a co workers name written on a receipt that was for a room sale (we stapled the receipt of the room sale on the back of the vip room tracking sheet to keep up with sales) I asked the manager what that was about. He told me that that is how the bookkeepers keep track of who sold which room so they will get credit and the surcharges of the sale. So I explained to him I was never told of this and explained that in my six month tenure I had never received anything. He then told me he would help me go through each sale with me to make sure I get the amount I was supposed to get. I was fired a week after that conversation because an entertainer tipped me 80 bucks when I made her 3500 I never complained or anything about it, but they fired me for not splitting that 80 bucks with everyone.
151	adjudicated	3	Still had moments of anxiety but I got through them. We can do it guys! It's so tough and I know I'll have bad days but hoping that the good days outweigh them. Completely shattered now though. Could sleep a million years.
185	adjudicated	3	The way he was acting was disproportional to the situation. He is yelling at me nonstop. We pulled into a store. He kept yelling mean things at me, to the point I was asking him to stop over and over,  telling him I didn't want it to escalate and to please go into the store. It all happened so fast.
369	adjudicated	1	New to this sub. Here is some background information about myself. ------------------------- I developed anxiety in my freshman year or high school. The traumatizing event happened when I was young, but an event when I was older triggered memories and sensations, and from then on I have dealt with axiety and panic attacks.
122	adjudicated	3	We'd be saving so much money with this new housr...its such an expensive city.... I did some googling in their language and found that it was illegal for them to do that. I was excited like oh ok if it happens ill call the police on them....  but now i did some further googling and turns out that if you sign the contract with that in it than everything is on their side... The contract is long term so we'd have to give 6months notice before leaving even if we give it next week ill still have to live six months with this.... i wanna die i swear i havent been so helpless and scared in so long.... Also two days ago my friend mentioned he ran into my ex who ruined my life and that he told him he wants to see mw and get closure.
96	adjudicated	3	I was not allowed to talk to anyone. I was not even allowed to be on Facebook. Erik made me feel like a prisoner. When i had the Facebook app my phone would always get this random pop up notification saying my login has expired but I was never even logging in because I was too scared of what Erik would do to me. I was only allowed to safely be on my phone while I was next to him and only if I was doing something like reading or watching videos.
190	adjudicated	3	And how I made her let me bring him back to her boyfriends house. How I begged him to come over. And how she was just trying to be a good person and discourage it. She's telling people how much I wanted him to fuck me. How RELENTLESS I was.
420	adjudicated	5	She literally said that I don’t even count as a boyfriend. --- Fastforward to now - or for the past few months to be precise, where an incredibly hot girl messages me on Tinder and asks me out. I delay meeting her and although she said she's fine waiting, she's still completely out of my league, and because I don't want to come off as desperate, I let her message me most of the time. Anyway, after a month we finally meet up, and it goes incredibly well.
84	adjudicated	2	I explained my situation without giving him how long I’ve been homeless but said I’d be back on my feet by December. That was at the beginning of the conversation. Then at the end of the conversation he said I should be good there for a week. What the heck! Now I have to find new places to park in hopes I don’t get bothered at night.
144	adjudicated	2	He blames me. He's wrong. [This is what my spine looks <url> I've got Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which is a genetic connective tissue disorder that makes faulty collagen everywhere in my body, so my muscles are always in pain trying to keep my body in place (and have clearly failed in that regard). I've had symptoms all my life.
334	adjudicated	2	"Am I wrong to be pissed about this? Was he really just being nice to her or is he just biding his time until they live closer?   ---   **tl;dr**: My boyfriend said ""you never know what the future holds"" when talking to a former fling. He says he was just being nice."
374	adjudicated	2	It certainly seemed like we were both really feeling it, and ended up sleeping together after the second date (realize this is a little soon). After the first few dates we decided to host a party together around the holidays and for some reason after this her interest level dropped severely. Told me it was moving too quickly and she was scared that it was headed toward something she wasn't ready for. I backed off after this, eventually called her a few weeks later (because communication between us had severely slowed down). I attempted to end what we were doing because i could feel she wasn't interested anymore.
494	adjudicated	2	"That's it. My mom made me delete it and said ""that's what is wrong with your generation, you act too grown."" Nothing about my picture was ""grown"" I was actually wearing a long white t shirt and boyfriend jeans. Even when we go to the beach with my siblings, me and my sister were wearing the exact same bikini and she said something to me about ""needing to sit my fast tailed butt down."" Mind you, my sister is two years younger than me and the bikinis weren't even provocative in a bikini sense."
270	adjudicated	4	My mom is a single mom working two shifts every day and she cannot wrangle a full grown man like my brother anymore. So she lets him do what he wants as long as he can pay a small piece of rent. So he works with friends doing god knows what. He's home around 2pm every day and he will always tear apart the fridge looking for food, microwave some gross stuff, then drop the dirty plates in the sink. He makes SUCH A MESS everywhere he goes it's absolutely disgusting.
307	adjudicated	2	I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either. It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away. Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?

61	adjudicated	5	I was so sure that tattooing was the career I wanted to get into but after completing the apprenticeship and even working as a tattoo artist AND piercer for about a year, I find myself still fucking miserable. Maybe even worse than before. The first tattoo shop I worked for was great but I had to move and I struggled finding another shop like that one. The owner of the last shop I worked in was just a total fucking asshole and treated me like dirt. There's a lot more detail with that story but to make it short, the entire experience made me terrified of going into tattoo shops now.
196	adjudicated	1	Lately I've just been having that terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach and also a feeling of nausea \- like I constantly need to throw up. I'm sleeping normal but still feeling so tired and drained and can't really focus at work \- and because of that I feel like my work performance is slipping up. I am constantly afraid that I'm going to lose my job and that my manager hates me. This has been happening so much more frequently. About a week ago my doc gave me prozac (once a day) and xanax (only as needed) prescriptions and I feel like it's helped with the bigger attacks and some dark thoughts but now its almost like just a little constant anxiety all the time and it sucks.
68	adjudicated	2	At the end of the night he literally dragged her to the end and caught a cab home by themselves. I didn’t think of anything as he was telling me that she would act up sometimes. But this time it was something different. My gf started crying all the way home, telling me how she told her that my friend “S” beats her. It took me a while to realize what she was telling me.
79	adjudicated	2	She tells me and her friends constantly about how this girl gives her butterflies, feelings of love, and worries out loud if she's gay/bi. Her boyfriend knows about this, since she talks to anyone she can about her life. He's a huge pushover though and doesn't seem to care allows her to continue texting and stalking this girl's social media profile. I'm okay with my sister exploring her sexuality, but I'm upset she's doing this to someone who takes care of everything for her. But he's okay with it, so is it any of my business?
129	adjudicated	3	I was sobbing and shaking and my whole front of my dress was open because he tore at it and th the buttons broke. I was shaking so much it took a while to button up my dress and the whole time it reminded me of when my ex attacked me. Was my trauma triggered? I tried to gather my things and got out and went into the back of his huge suv to get my things out of th backseat. I was hysterical.

67	adjudicated	1	Hi guys. I'm a current English major at my first year in uni, trying to save up enough money to participate in an in-depth language study in Hokkaido, Japan. My career goal has always been to teach English in Asia, and after years of deliberation and comparing the different countries I could teach in, I believe Japan is best suited to me. The only problem is, my current school only offers Japanese 1 and 2, and I need to be as close to fluent as possible in order to give me an edge in the hiring process. I know the prospect of studying abroad in Asia seems like a cushy vacation.
499	adjudicated	3	"For instance, there was a show on netflix that I thought would be fun to watch together, but she said she couldn't because she used to watch it with her ex and it reminds her of him. Like, are you even over him? She constantly compares me to her ex's in subtle (maybe not subtle) ways, like ""[ex] used to do this thing you do, and you know how I feel about that."" I'm not your ex, I don't think it's fair of you to compare me to him like that all the time. She says she's ""not used to being single,"" it kind of makes me feel like she's using me to get reassurance and validation."
125	adjudicated	2	Like sleep would never be a simple thing for me. So recently, I accidentally fell asleep at 8pm and I found myself awake around 4am. I immediately felt like I had screwed myself. My instinct was to try to go back to sleep but I decided, for whatever reason, not to. What I discovered was amazing.

97	adjudicated	3	I can't guarantee that I will never change my mind, but I've never dreamt of happily ever after, I don't really believe in eternal love and soulmates and all this stuff so I guess it's not really likely. I'm not asexual or aromantic, I love sex and I love him in a non-platonic way, I just can't compromise on that kind of thing, I wouldn't even know how to do it. I could meet his family, pretend to like them, pretend to bond with them and pretend to care, but that's really just lying to make him happy. I've tried it before and it makes me hating myself and them. I've always told him the the truth about the level of commitment I'm comfortable with, but nevertheless I feel like I'm leading him on.
301	adjudicated	3	Picture the following scenario. You get to the point of high school with all your elementary school friends, you are in a class separate from nearly all of them. You are 'very' good friends with 2 of them, and at the beginning of the semester you are always with them. Being friends for years, the three of you are a narrow circle of good friends who are always together. As you get acquainted to classmates and meet new people, you slowly get caught in the thought of wanting to spend more time with these new people you've grown accustomed to, and cut off ties with your old buddies, because you feel like you've got a bit tired of them.
219	adjudicated	3	Is he that desperate to see me? Why does he do this? If his friends don't mind and I don't mind, should I even be concerned? Maybe I'm blowing a little issue out of proportions but just curious to hear what others have to say! Thanks for reading!
478	adjudicated	2	My problem is most of these articles mention getting your friend professional help, but he's already seeing a psych and therapist. The other thing frequently suggested is to gently nudge them to do things. This is a problem currently though because of the physical distance between us and their lack of a phone currently. Has anyone else gone through or is experiencing something similar? I could really use some advice 😟
309	adjudicated	1	So this is a new dynamic I am learning, and attempting to exercise patience with. But sometimes I message her pictures of animals or just something about my day. Even if she doesn't respond, I don't mind. I just like to share. I don't want to bombard her with questions about her opinion on the nature of our friendship/relationship, or make her feel pressure like I want something to happen faster than it is.

373	adjudicated	3	I've always had this slight urge to drop out of society since my early teens. Nothing I've taken all that seriously until now though.

492	adjudicated	2	First things first, this may contain triggers for several different types of abuse. If this is no the right place for this post, by all means get rid of it, last thing I want to do is cause trouble for others. I'll refer to my wife as M Some background: My wife's parents immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 80s with her brother, wife was born in the early 90s.

280	adjudicated	2	I screamed and my mum helped me until I passed out. I went to the doctor the next day and they referred me on to get a diagnosis for PTSD as well. I get flashies about once every couple of months now and it gets more and more terrifying each time. About a year and a half before GCSE's (finals for you Americans) my anxiety started to show. I would be super stressed about every little test in school and had a baseline amount of stress building up as I got closer to my exam dates.
253	adjudicated	1	I wrote a 4000-word short story on depression to bring awareness. I need around 10-15 people to answer the questionnaire.

52	adjudicated	3	But yeah, I was afraid and dumb and feeling vulnerable when I wrote it. So thanks to you guys for calming me, and sharing your own stories (really helped alot). tldr : I was sooper stoopid, but me and my dad are still cool. But thank you to everyone who calmed me down on here when I posted. It meant alot.
412	adjudicated	1	I'll try to keep this short. I've never been able to feel empathy towards other people, I'm not a sociopath or anything (as far as I know), I know when I should feel bad for/with somebody but I can't make myself care as much as I want to. _ Anyways, my mothers best friend of 45 years just killed himself and she's pretty torn up about it. I gave her a hug and what not but I have no idea what else I'm supposed to do.
479	adjudicated	3	I stuck it out because I didn't have the means to leave and I had a hard time accepting it was abuse. I tried to change my behaviour, but nothing was ever good enough. It was a typical narcissistic and empath relationship. I slowly realized even if I was wrong, it didn't warrant this treatment. Cue months of gaslighting that I was suffering from ppd (this may be somewhat true, but didn't dismiss the fact that he was also abusive.)
142	adjudicated	2	Their plan is so bad that some days I want to go out and be homeless on my own, with my own plan but I feel that it would be a bad decision to be on the streets. We've stayed at a couple of relatives places but my mom always messes it up (she's r/raisedbynarcissists material) so we left the first time (her brother) but the second time (her sister) we got kicked out. This was mostly a rant but I'd like some advice - any advice would be nice. Tell me I'm not crazy for wanting to leave California. Should I even try to convince them?
184	adjudicated	2	Obviously this doesn’t help the mental health. I have a great relationship with a professor at my institution. Because I go to a SLAC close professor / student relationships are encouraged.

This person has also offered to Skype me over break if I needed to chat or if being home became difficult.

In my life thus far I don't really take other peoples things.

487	adjudicated	3	I was raised by a narcissistic grandmother and emotionally unavailable mother. In fact, when I was born, she tried to take it upon herself to take full custody away from my mother because apparently my mom was 'unfit' to be a mother. She never did because she found out that my biological father might have had to be involved. My grandma kept me away from my father my entire life, he barely knows I exist, I've never spoken directly with him, in fact, his identity was hidden from me for 22 years, up until last May. My grandmother was very emotionally abusive towards me as a child.

305	adjudicated	2	I was talking to my counselor today about my anxiety disorder, and he suggested to me that I try to reframe my anxiety as excitement, as they cause the same adrenal response. He suggested I view this adrenal response as simply “emotional arousal to something something novel.” This conversation caused me to have the revelation that for at least the past 5 years, I haven’t been able to experience anything “exciting” as something other than anxiety inducing. Things like first dates, roller coasters, etc. are all miserable for me because of my heightened nervous response.
481	adjudicated	2	Other things that are good about me... well, I can cook really well! I can make anything as long as I have a recipe. I can also draw anime art, too, though I'm still an amateur (I can show it privately!). My other interests include being a huge anime fan, MMORPGs (I play World of Warcraft currently! ), learning to play instruments, writing, cooking, spirituality, supernatural, basically anything really.
27	adjudicated	3	Im studying at a university abroad And I have failed or got a really bad grade my first semester subjects due to starting a month late and searching for accommodation for atleast 2 weeks or I would have stayed on the streets. I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed. The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company.

Festival season is starting next week and all my friends are excited to go and see the bands.
94	adjudicated	3	Quite frankly, him being so nonchalant about the whole thing kind of baffles me. Does he just trust her that much? Or is it me he trusts? His reaction (or lack of one) kept on making me think I was overreacting and reading too much into things. I could see that Fred certainly thought it was messed up, even half conscious.

235	adjudicated	4	A viewpoint that some of my asshole uncles, aunts, and other various family members have encouraged for reasons I won’t get into lest this post becomes my magnum opus. Anyway, her comment actually got me a little pissed. So, I sniped back, “Yeah, everyone wishes someone will cook, provide for them, and just take care of everything while they just relax but this isn’t Aladdin. Plus, if it was, you’d have to rub the lamp, not Ron, and I just don’t see how that would work out.” Everyone laughed, So did their significant others. All Ron kept saying was some variation of “That’s so true!” while laughing.

However, the way in which he did it leaves me wondering if he left the door open or not. The reason why he broke up with me is that this coming semester, he will be working/in class for 12 hours a day and he doesn’t want to put me through that, since he won’t have enough time to give me. He then said that he didn’t think this would be the last time we spoke, and that we would somehow find our way back into each other’s lives eventually.
21	adjudicated	2	One friend went to the same college while the other didn't, but we still kept in touch. Obviously, that didn't go so well. For the friend in the same college, I thought that just asking her to meet up and talk would be nice, but I feel I was too persistent, and she broke all ties with me, asking me to never contact her again. The same goes with the other friend. I tried to keep in touch, but I guess my methods were totally wrong and creepy.
149	adjudicated	1	But I'd like to reciprocate her feelings. I think I do truly love her, but I'm not going to fuel her infatuation by saying it. Should I just sit back and wait? What signs should I look for? Should I confront her again?
285	adjudicated	2	Whenever the mutual friend would go to the bathroom, she kept making eyes at me, and me at her. The physical chemistry was palpable. After we were about to leave, our friend took off, and we hung out in the parking lot, me embracing her for lengthy periods of time. I wanted to just go for a kiss, but I knew it would be crossing a permanent boundary. Afterwards, she approached me at work.
376	adjudicated	5	More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer.
131	adjudicated	3	She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end. Oh, and to rub salt into the wounds I even noticed she unliked my profile picture of all things. Ouch.
46	adjudicated	2	Am I sick? The dreams got worse. My mother felating me and soaping me in the bath. I also dreamt about terrible things happening to my newborn daughter, kidnappings, terrible accidents and finally the last straw: Me inapproapriately touching her in the bath and her felating me. That is my nightmare image burned into my mind.
338	adjudicated	1	Hello all, for the next two years I’ll probably be living in my truck. I am going to college for free (thanks AmeriCorps) but I can’t afford to live in a real home. So I live in my truck. Any tips for keeping it clean and keeping things orderly? It’s so much harder than I thought it would be.
226	adjudicated	4	I created a CV today, but it just filled me with dread considering having to apply and do interviews/god forbid actually have to have a job where I'm responsible for things and could end up screwing up so badly. On top of that I'm terrified by the current situation of applying for uni and am fearing the worst that I will have a panic attack at the interview for it and be rejected. I feel like such a burden and I can't do anything right. I have been considering suicide for the past month. I'm just so anxious and depressed all the time and if I can't even get a part time job, what is the point in me?
207	adjudicated	1	That was about 7 hours ago. Normally, I do not get much effect from tea because I only ever drink half a cup as I don't like it that much. However, I have been feeling jittery all day and my heart periodically feels as though it is racing. I have that adrenalized and uneasy feeling that I always get with caffeine. It wasn't really bothering me because I knew it was probably from the caffeine.
163	adjudicated	1	<url> To learn more about what my disabilities are like for me, you can read this post. <url> in it I talk about the loneliness. I really am scared. Posting here helped before, but I think just getting everything out helps more than anything, so thanks for taking time to read.
244	adjudicated	3	He felt my chest and sort of kissed my abs, all this weird stuff he never did before. We did it again the next week and he seemed more into it this time, like a lot more. I have never seen him like this, ever. He started moaning and shit, and all this weird stuff, and then near the end, he literally kissed me and sort of got on top of me. We've kissed before for the webcam, but we pretty much never kiss besides that.
357	adjudicated	1	Hello everyone, A very close friend of mine was in an accident a few years ago and deals with PTSD. He has horrific nightmares that wake him up and keep him in a state of fright. We live in separate provinces, so when he does have his dreams it is difficult to comfort him. Each time he calls, and I struggle with what to say on the phone.
71	adjudicated	3	CW: mentions of self-harm, suicide I feel so overwhelmed. The flashbacks, the panic attacks, being triggered so easily, sometimes by mere words alone. I get so entrenched in my flashbacks that I can barely medicate myself, and my friend has to intervene and give me a good dose of clonazepam to get me out of it. I can't talk about my trauma, it sends me straight into a state of anxiety and panic.
366	adjudicated	2	If I go to an interview for example, I'll know that I'm a good candidate, I'll know that if I don't get it there will always be other opportunities and it's no big deal. Yet I still get nervous because it's something that I want, I want that employer to like me. If I go to an interview with no expectations at all, not even wanting the job (I've done this a few times for practice interviewing), it'll turn out great. What are your thoughts on this? Edit: FYI I'm talking mostly about social anxiety, though it has happened that I get anxiety in the most random places like just going upstairs in a building.
409	adjudicated	1	Maybe anyone with a history of abuse or trauma can tell me if there are particular things to be sensitive to here: I tried to be supportive but obviously failed in the end here. She's talking about wanting to divorce me. We're looking into couples therapy. I really appreciate any insight or advice. **TLDR**: Wife is working on an art piece that is important for her career in the arts non-profit world.
422	adjudicated	1	I texted him good morning. Then begun the message about how I would love to, but I can't because marriage is something I want now. Before I got the chance to send that text, he sent another one. He had come to the conclusion that he wanted to marry me. Genuinely.
262	adjudicated	3	I asked for nothing but a declaration (a document detailing finances) from the divorce. He stole from me. I asked for nothing but restitution. He fought, forced me to hire a lawyer (more money), dragged out the case, and led to have alimony imposed upon if he failed to make restitution. He still failed to even honestly attempt to make restitution.
120	adjudicated	2	I did a few times but it always just blew up in us breaking up and then me being miserable for awhile. I just don't know if I should bother anymore and commit to the fact that I'm alone and will probably be for the rest of my life. Both my brothers are married, most of my family members have partners apart from me so I sort of feel like the odd one out there. I'm sort of just unsure of what to do next.   ---
390	adjudicated	4	"The news is always problematic for folks with PTSD, but it just feels so much worse lately. I am not one to regularly get triggered by the news, but this weekend just was too much. I just felt like I was swept into this gigantic downward spiral. I really want to go clean up my room and get some food ready for tomorrow (the work week) (AKA do some ""adulating"") but I am so exasperated, exhausted, and burnt out that I just can't. And that is going to make the week even worse."
197	adjudicated	1	To the typical bystander he looks to be in a bad way, but actually he’s happy. He had a mental breakdown over Christmas and was sectioned. Because of this the social services have been visiting him and due to their insistence of better accommodation, he has had to use his savings to buy a shed which he now sleeps in. He is profoundly proud of his self sufficiency and freedom and desperately does not want to be put in a home or helped in any way. The shed (although better than his trailer) isn’t insulated.
250	adjudicated	2	The first two times I had done these psychedelics I was mostly alone, the last one however was with my friends. So me and two of my closest friends (let's call them Joseph and Andy) took our tabs in a pretty comfortable setting (as has been suggested by most who have taken these drugs). It was at Joseph's apartment. About an hour later Andy has definitely been hit the strongest with him being the most talkative and I the least. The visuals were amazing as usual and the sound is also distorted as usual.
14	adjudicated	2	I suffer from depression and anxiety, I didn't have the courage to tell  him no.. Although he never hit me, I was never allowed my own bank card, I wasn't allowed my car keys... He yelled and cursed at not only myself but my young children too.. One day last week, he told my legally blind son to open his fucking eyes when he couldn't find his snow pants.... That did it for me, he was gone.
303	adjudicated	3	I go from living happily, almost as if that part of my life didn't happen, to being floored by pain. I feel guilty to myself for how strong the reactions are so many years later. I feel guilty to my partner who has to deal with it even though he's not the one who caused me this hurt. He's been nothing short of wonderful, but I'm scared my past will end up driving him away. I certainly wish I could get away from me sometimes.
340	adjudicated	4	His consequences will never reflect or equate to the suffering I have endured and the life-long trauma that will impede on the rest of my life. Because on March 21st and 22nd in 2017, my humanity was shaken and distorted in ways that I still struggle to resolve. It exists in the shadows of nightmares I still have of his face, his screams, his weapons, his murder threats, suicide threats, and fists. It is perpetuated by the adrenaline and primal fear I have when I see vehicles that look like his. It is in my mind when I have to loop around my neighborhood before going home, out of fear that I will see him, because he ONLY lives 5 minutes from me.
476	adjudicated	1	Willing to pay a slightly higher rate of interest if it means being able to place the order for my supplies. Links to my art and/or printing business and any other info available upon request. Thanks for your time and consideration! &#x200B; (EDIT: Forgot to mention that I have both PayPal and Venmo)
3	adjudicated	2	I still wake up from nightmares about beating Adams head through a wall. Its the last thing i think about before i fall asleep and the first thing i think about when i wake up. I just want to stop thinking about it but nothing seems to work. I feel like I’m a prisoner to my own brain. Literally any advice or personal experience is welcome.
28	adjudicated	3	And I can't accept it anymore. I can't allow it anymore. It's time to come clean about the pain it causes me to have this sorry excuse of a man be so close to someone that is forever connected to me. Any suggestions, personal experiences, or strategies you used to help relieve the anxiety that is experienced before and during would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you for taking some time to help.
113	adjudicated	2	An hour ago I felt like I was having stroke like symptoms, but they passed so maybe it was a panic attack. Now I'm just very lightheaded. I am hoping when I get my ultrasound and my work issue is resolved (both next week), all this will pass and I can chalk it up to anxiety...but I'm not sure and am terrified. Has anyone with anxiety experienced these kinds of symptoms? I feel like I'm not going to make it until next week at this rate.
448	adjudicated	3	I sent a respectful email to my primary psychiatrist explaining my thoughts on how it was inappropriate to have Paterno's picture prominently displayed. Am I fucked up in the head for thinking this wrong? In the past, I had a mild traumatic brain injury. Sometimes I over react. 24 hours post appointment, I'm still bitter about the Paterno pics.
