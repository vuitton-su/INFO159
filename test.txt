395	adjudicated	4	for years i've had this overwhelming sense of doom, this feeling of having been fucked up. i hate to even say this considering he has his own history of csa and physical abuse, but i genuinely wonder about my dad sometimes. there's just this awful feeling that hits me out of nowhere sometimes. i cant breathe and everything is just awful and i feel so sure that something happened. but other times i feel so stupid and evil for even thinking that.
92	adjudicated	1	* I refused to fold his underwear. Just a couple smacks this time. (age 9) * I couldn't convince my dad to sign adoption papers so stepdad could adopt me. Late nights with mom ensue and I get special attention from stepdad for a week or two (age 7 or 8)

I was looking in my area and there are some nice areas where water meets land that are away from homes but still in the town. It seems exciting to live near the water, but I have no idea what I could face. I should say, I'm not afraid to be homeless, this isn't a bummer for me. I'm pretty stoic as well, but it's still nice to be prepared."

They are harmless. He doesn't drink or do drugs, they don't hang out with girls. It's he and a bunch of old men who like to play pool and poker.
446	adjudicated	2	Hey guys I have PTSD from years of emotional abuse and neglect by my narcissistic parents. I am living in their house again now due to some financial hardships (Im 22), I am constantly being triggered and am experiencing intensified symptoms. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this situation? I feel completely trapped, I need to figure out how to manage these symptoms because they're really getting in the way of my functioning. Sorry for the lack of detail/emotion but I am so drained.
386	adjudicated	1	Last time we talked she promised that it wouldn’t be the last time we saw each other, and she said she couldn’t imagine there ever being a last time we saw each other. I don’t know what my exact question is on all of this but if anyone has any advice, criticism or has gone though a similar experience I’d appreciate input. Thanks for reading Tl;dr: Girlfriend and I are taking an indefinite break, but we still see us in the future. Should I maintain this hope for us despite some complications during the break up?
173	adjudicated	2	I brought it up to him (assuming this forum would tell me to) and he got very livid at me. Now we’re not speaking (His friend is still at his house). Not sure what to do. TL;DR: bfs friend from out of town is staying with him while I was away. Not sure if they are doing normal friend stuff, or if my bf has a crush.
137	adjudicated	1	We will also provide links to treatment and informational resources throughout the study. Please send us a private message to receive a link to the screening questionnaire to see if you qualify for the study. If you qualify, you will be told more about the study and you can decide whether or not you want to participate. If you don’t qualify, you may be told about a different study that you can participate in instead. Thanks for your consideration!
214	adjudicated	2	I haven’t said anything to him yet because I’m not sure how someone would take hearing that their partner has such fluctuations of feelings towards them (especially since he told me he loves me and is somewhat clingy). Nonetheless, I know a conversation will need to be had but I want to get my feelings in order first. What would y’all recommend, Reddit? TL;DR I have “hot and warm” feelings towards my boyfriend. Can’t figure out why.

174	adjudicated	1	My wife suffers from chronic migraines, of which, she is allergic to most of the medications they have out there for this. Our options for relief comes in the form of Methadone that is the only thing that helps, I know what a lot of you are thinking and no we do not do drugs or anything that the stigma of methadone has with it. I paid for her meds no problem for a while while she was filing for disability which many of you know is a very lengthy process. While I was working there I heard rumors that there was a commission system set up for vip hosts that includes giving the surcharges of the bottle sales to the vip host. I asked each manager and none of them could say one way or the other (strange right?).
459	adjudicated	3	aaaa sorry I feel so dumb for messing up like that, I hate when people lie and I really hope I don't come across like that to you but now I just sound desperate? I'm s o r r y I don't think he'll be online for a while but maybe in a few hours you could try and talk to him about it hello?
282	adjudicated	2	After getting startled, I have this thing where I'm really angry and defensive for 30-120 minutes afterwards. I can put myself in the most calm of situations, but the duration of this seems to be somewhat independent of my environment. I'm guessing this is because my PTSD brain does not respond well to stress hormones? Sometimes I try to push through it and just go about my day anyway, but it's usually counter-productive. I'd like to train my service dog to alert to the physiological change.
378	adjudicated	1	My PTSD has manifested itself in disassociation, flashbacks, panic attacks and general anxiety and depression. I believe that my PTSD is related to my previous abusive relationship also, sexual assault, traumatic childhood experiences and an alcoholic parent. I am looking for any advice related to these issues that may help me learn to manage them. I am currently seeing a therapist and going through CBT and I mediate regularly as well. Any suggestions or resources would be greatly appreciated!
342	adjudicated	2	I never did, but I pretend that I did, and I'm still in contact with her. Nobody would ever guess that I endured what I did. I'm in a competitive medical sciences program and thriving. I've had a wonderful boyfriend who supports and loves me unconditionally, and he knows everything that has happened to me. His mother is great, I love her, and I have aunts that I latched on to for maternal support.
455	adjudicated	2	At the very least, I need help keeping the RV running so that I can get food at least, keep going to the doctor to see if I can get well enough to work again. And if i end up filing for bankruptcy and lose my home (as might happen in the next month or two, to be honest), I'll need it to sleep in. So if anyone to help out even a little bit with this $575, I could really use it. Thank you! Update:
411	adjudicated	2	"I would like to reach out for help from someone supportive before an episode becomes too intense to ask for help. I would like to acknowledge the symptoms and temporary nature of the situation as to let it pass without causing additional damage. I finally realized that fighting my traumatic episodes is like a rigid oak tree trying to resist a flooding dam. Do any of you guys have ways to be ""okay"" with an episode? If so, how do you find the flexibility and patience to not fight against it?"
276	adjudicated	2	-when talking to someone i get out of breath easily while talking (newest one) -can't sit properly, I have to sit in a weird position or else its really uncomfortable -easily startled (for example, im sitting in my room, watching youtube and all of a sudden someone opens the door and I get startled) in general im really not a easy to scare person, but this is ridicilous.. Im wondering if I can get rid of these symptoms, if its possible, sometimes I think that im neck deep in this anxiety that there is no way back to 100% normal... but then again sometimes I tell myself everything will be good again. So yea, some tips ,similar experiences / symptoms / if and how did you get rid of them are gladly appreciated:) Thanks !
438	adjudicated	1	Do you huddle up in the corner of some obscure building that's out of the way? Under a pine tree that's thick enough to prevent any outsiders knowing you're there? Those are kind of the best ideas I have... but I really don't know and I would greatly appreciate any advice. I don't want to give too many details but I live in a city of just over 100,000 people. I'm already on food and medical assistance.
10	adjudicated	4	So I had to look for work again. She gave me hell the entire time. I just found another job at the end of February, but my start date wouldn't be till near the end of march. That wasn't good enough for her (as if I set the start date), so she breaks up with me, and kicks me out. Now I'm fucked, because I have work.
30	adjudicated	2	I don't want to be nice to him because I don't like him and certainly don't like how he treats me. I know it's not my fault and I am not a bad person. I have never had friends, family, or other partners ever accuse me of the things he accuses me of so I know it's not real. I just needed to vent because I hate being trapped in this situation. I don't have anyone I can stay with and am still waiting on housing assistance which at the very least will take another 6 months and that's if I am lucky and the wait-list isn't too long.
419	adjudicated	1	I've never been medically diagnosed with anxiety, and I know that I would need to see a professional to officially determine if I really had anxiety, but sometimes I relate to symptoms of anxiety I see online and wonder if I should be concerned. Some things that have led me to think I may have anxiety: I've been performing on stages for all of my life, but I still find my heart racing and knees weak every time I'm on stage. One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though.
465	adjudicated	3	Now, I'm kind of annoyed both because this should be common sense and because now it doesn't seem like he cares how I feel. I don't want to seem needy or controlling, though. Am I overreacting? How should I bring it up again?   ---
191	adjudicated	2	Yeah, not so much. I had a minor surgery on my neck today that just used local anesthetic, so I was fully conscious for it. Everything was fine since I'm not squeamish - until I realized they needed to strap me down to make sure I didn't move. It's a delicate procedure; I understood. But I hadn't been in restraints since the medical trauma, and I completely dissociated.
380	adjudicated	2	My main obstacle now is getting said training. Everything is in the city and it's so loud and bright there. I have enough blankets for now. And I'll give my kitty to the humane society before conditions are cruel. I'm not a monster, I'm just not quite ready to give her up yet.
453	adjudicated	2	However, over the next day she changed her mind and is now convinced that she has given us enough chances, that nothing would change (in terms of me and my issues) if we tried again. The kicker is that she still loves me, she’s still attracted to me (we got onto normal conversation, joked around as usual, even had sex twice in the last couple of days), she comforted me as I bawled about her leaving. We’ve been texting a fair bit since she went, some normal and some more serious conversation. She is now back with her mother, she has taken enough clothes for the week and will come back next weekend to pick up the rest of her stuff. We’re also seeing each other on Tuesday as we have Pokémon Go plans that we can’t miss (don’t judge us).
152	adjudicated	2	I thought why not try and look for a girl at the gym, but as you can figure, at 3:30am there's not as much fish in the see. Though I fear any partner not sharing my passion for fitness will not bear the strict diet I follow and the amount of time and energy I invest daily into the whole topic. #**TL;DR** ish And it is also not me wanting a girlfriend right now, do or die-esque. I am also way more interested in finding a girl sharing the same passions, aspiring to achieve similar goals, sharing the same values and providing a safe haven for one another long-term rather than just having some fun and being superficial about it.
353	adjudicated	1	"Hi PTSD forums, Selective mutism has been something i have been afflicted with for 7 years since middle school. It was only in senior year of high school that I began speaking again thanks to the help of a few friends whom i no longer am in contact with and also my football coach/teacher. Now in college however I dread presentations. Often, I would lock down and say one or two sentences and after that say ""i'm done, ill hand it off to my group member"" or I would splurge out incoherent sentences that have no purpose or thought behind them during presentations and people would have a confused look on their faces."
203	adjudicated	3	Lately I have started having some unusual episodes. \### Introduction I  have never had flashbacks as far as I know, but I was always upset every time somebody unexpectedly grabbed me, or worse, inflicted me some pain,  even if accidentally. If I saw that coming, than OK, but if not, I was  instantly teleported to a very bad place, emotionally. I was not  experiencing something I could call flashbacks, but there sure were very dark, painful and overwhelming feelings.
248	adjudicated	3	This internet ban subsequently resulted in me failing my studies, and in turn lead to my parents despising my relationship. Needless to say, they had noticed a huge change in my personality on top of failing my studies. I want allowed to speak to these friends either. She worried that they would be finding ways to show porn to me, and made them out to be terrible friends, which I of course believed. I failed to mention how incredibly good she was at manipulation.
273	adjudicated	1	So I found a counselor who I like and I've been to the first session where she got my background and overview of my problems I guess. Then, we went right in and she had me working on coping strategies etc. and she said in the future what things we will work on. So my question is: I didn't really say everything that I've had trouble with and how much it really affects me. Like she knows most of it, but between my parent being in the room part of the time and the nervousness of being there, I realized I didn't say everything.
140	adjudicated	2	3. I was meeting with someone. 4. Because I’m so tired of wasting my time on someone who is so insecure and paranoid that it interferes with both of our lives. You deserve this because you impose your paranoia onto me and demand impossible things.

I sometimes augment my income with Mturk, but additional advice on how to make a little extra cash would be appreciated (would have to be one time gigs though due to the nature of my disability, I can't hold down a long term job. Stuff like plasma donation, opinion surveys, medical studies, etc.) Any kind of life hacks, government assistance, etc. that I do not know about would be appreciated.
0	adjudicated	3	I have GAD with obsessive thoughts ( ocd) that are health related ( hypochondria ) And I am 18, I have been single my whole life, have never had a girlfriend or a kiss or anything of the sort. In elementary school I liked 4 girls throughout my time there and they all just ended up as friends and I never confessed my feelings. In middle school I liked the same girl for 2 years who rejected me. Then I liked two more girls, one who ended up as a friend and another moved. Now in high school I’ve liked about 11 girls, and no luck at ALL with any of them.
300	adjudicated	4	I am called back as a few secondary characters in a play with plenty leads and these character have one line each and sometimes no lines at all so I’m basically ensemble again. To top that off I got called back as the same four characters that like 13 girls are going to compete for and one of them is a new girl in school that this was her first audition. I’m a bit jealous and I know I shouldn’t be but I’m not jealous that the new girl got in, it’s a mix of jealousy and disappointment and dissatisfaction in myself. Plus these two guys that I might have a slight crush on are called back for main characters that kiss the leads in the play so I’m a bit mad about that too. Sorry for ranting so much and I might sound like a bitch but I just need some place to rant and this felt like the best place for it since I’m so stressed and mad at myself about this.
399	adjudicated	3	I don't mind the fact that she goes, I don't even mind if she goes at the same time as me. I just wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of doing it together. How do I convey this to her without looking like a selfish asshole? **Tl;dr: I prefer to work out by myself for various reasons. My roommate decided to start going with me and is requesting that I make accommodations to my schedule and routine so that she can join me.
445	adjudicated	2	It would be awesome to see how many people I can have help me wish her a Happy Birthday (sounds clickbait-y, so forgive me.) She loves our dog, Bear, Beyoncé, and a good NetFlix Original series. So basically, she's an incredible lady. Not that I'm biased or anything. Any Happy Birthday wish would be awesome!
327	adjudicated	3	I was at my first party with her and I got really drunk and when im drunk i like making out with all my girl friends, not long kisses but with tongue. My boyfriend is fine with this because its girls but I eventually kissed her and it was so nice, not like any other friend. We ended up in bed making out for approximately 2 hours. We became even closer than before and we had sleepovers every friday, just her and me. We would get drunk alone together every time and then kiss more and also go a bit further for hours.
402	adjudicated	1	At this point, my friend's family's finances are all but running out. We started a GoFundMe to help them out and would love to get any help we can.

I am trying to raise funds to establish an endowed scholarship in her name through Olivet-Nazarene University in Illinois to help students with interests in music to honor her memory. Why would you consider giving to a stranger? Because maybe cancer has touched YOUR life. Donna was your everyday woman.
329	adjudicated	3	I went to the ER recently because it reached 100 bpm and wouldn’t go down but in retrospect it’s because I was reinforcing my anxiety by numbers high, it won’t go down, oh shit number’s higher and it won’t go down. Repeat. I turned off heart rate tracking and fitness tracking. It’s a shame because I feel it’s turning off a valuable part of the device but quantifiable health data has become one of my triggers. If x to x+5 is a healthy range I freak at x+6 etc.
238	adjudicated	2	This is one if the most perplexing symptoms I get when I'm in high anxiety or panic mode. It's the only time I can think of as yawning as being stressful. I have a lot of fatigue anxiety. The more anxious I get, the more fatigued, which makes me anxious. I've almost fallen asleep after calming down and then I have a big yawn and that just restarts it.
294	adjudicated	1	You have mental noise: These are thoughts that arise spontaneously and we have no control over. For some people these are very negative. Behind this mental noise we have the observer however, this is you. When you are engaged in a activity that creates flow, your mental noise is reduced, and the observer has complete control. Engaging in mediation allows us to get in contact with this observer, separating us from our mental noise.

I would love to be given links to sites that can help my brother and I to places that will take us. Because today was the last straw with my 'mother' hitting my brother with a tennis racket as my 'dad' restrained him down on the couch.
463	adjudicated	3	Well maybe afraid isn't the best word, but it's not far off. I'm not worried they can physically harm me or anything, nor do I even hate kids, most kids I actually like, but certain kids, like uncle's girlfriend's one kids, make me uncomfortable and make my anxiety go off badly. He's like 6 or something like that, but he is disrespectful to me, and harasses me when I'm around. He'll make smart ass remarks which although typical small child insults, get to me, not because they hurt my feelings so much, but it gets to me that I'm so pathetic, I can't even demand respect from a fucking child. Today, playing some backyard cricket with my brother and other cousin (a very respectful kid who I love), he asks if he can peg the ball at my groin, to which I obviously say no, so what does he do?
7	adjudicated	3	So my brothers wedding is soon. Like very very soon. My fiance recently lost their job and we had to move and then a bunch of medical drama happened. I told him I would do everything I could to get there, I am honestly not sure if I want to go to prove I can, just because I care for my brother or because I am not being smart and compassionate enough to say no to myself. But there I was dead set on going, despite the obvious problems and the advice from the majority of the people everywhere I go that I should not go.
319	adjudicated	1	I let out a loud whistle, as we often invited new comers to go ride. The guy on the black bike was named Devin. Devin had just moved to town a couple weeks prior and had posted in our facebook group looking for friends to ride with. After talking for a couple more minutes, we took off on our adventure. A couple blocks down a guy and girl were cruising on a GSXR - I waved to them.
284	adjudicated	1	Hey everyone, I’ve had quite the journey the last couple of years trying to get through a masters program in psychology to be a therapist and also dealing with health concerns. I came upon some research that led me to some conclusions that could possibly help some women who have gone through similar situations. So I was raped when I was 10 years old and gone through other various forms of trauma all throughout my childhood. I functioned pretty well until I got to my graduate program in clinical psychology. I had been in a stable relationship with a man who is supportive and loving so everything felt like it was going great.

62	adjudicated	4	They weep after every session with me and all I can do is give them the thousand yard stare. I don't even know how to feel yet my girlfriend says I'm selfless to a fault how I can be I don't know she always says she wishes she could have rescued kid me from my mother and has been the saint of a women that is still by my side and still wants to marry me. How and why I don't know I feel worthless ans like I have nothing to offer up other than my love and the constant promise I'll never leave her. I have lashed out so many times at her for things not even done by her and I die inside a little more everytime I do. I know she knows why it happens and understands the brain chimstry behind my psych issues as she is a sociology and psychology major/minor.
264	adjudicated	2	Then he didn't talk  to me for day and after that suddenly he pretends like nothing ever happened. He also tries to tell me that I remember things wrong in these fights, and that I am the one who always starts them. Last night this happened again, until he said some things that I don't feel are possible to take back, like telling me I am a loser and all of my friends hate me because I'm an a#$hole, and that he regretted bringing me up. I feel that crossed a line, due to the fact that this argument started because he told me when I was barbecuing sausages not to put the lid down, even though that's the way I always do it. He then proceeds to tell me my memories of cooking sausages have never happened, and then starts the fight/argument.
239	adjudicated	3	I'd like to note that I have had a couple close individuals look at my emails, evidence, etc since the last court date. I'm not that crazy, but I showed them the emails because I wanted to make sure they were real. The emails, evidence, and notes are all real. I checked my phone history, and the phone calls to the advocate and office are all logged and sufficient in length to indicate that an actual conversation occurred. I never doubted reality before the abuse, and I have never done so outside of the abuse.

I think I want to not see her in the future, but I don't know if I am overreacting? I also don't want to cause drama in the family, which is very stressful to me. If I could get some advice that would be very helpful, thank you. Tldr: should I stay in contact with my sister who still talks to our dad?

No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted."

59	adjudicated	2	I’m just getting done with my training at my new job which I’m so thankful to have. It’s just that I’m down to my last $40 in my bank account and I don’t get paid for another 2 weeks. I’ve been eating peanut butter and jelly to get by but it’s becoming really hard and also depressing. I’ve never been this anxious about how I’m going to eat but here I am. Please help me.
473	adjudicated	4	So I texted her a message saying “7:45” , I sent it with the quotations to let her know that she’s late and I’m starving. So F2 responds to me through her phone, by voice message. She gave me a very sassy attitude telling me to “remove the pipe from my ass and eat a snack”. I had already needed to eat a snack since they made me wait a half an hour, I don’t think that her response was warranted for what I said. I get what I said was a little petty but I don’t think I deserved that attitude.
413	adjudicated	3	Now that I’m single I find that I don’t have much friends I can hang out with. With the few guy friends I have we all just play sports together and that’s literally it, nothing outside of that. No one I can really be like “hey let’s go to this concert” or “Yo, let’s hit this party up”. I also feel like I’m kind of too mature for ppl my age, which is conflict sometimes too. I also genuinely want some gal friends and nothing romantic but just some girls to hang out with but I feel all girls just assume all guys have bad intentions or just want to get in their pants.

I got trouble to fall asleep since some time and if she is here I wake up between 6-8am after I fall asleep at 2-3am because of noise she make in bath or kitchen. One time she came here without telling me and I had to cancel my plans with my girlfriend which made both of us really angry. She even interfere how I painted my room after 10+ years looking like shit even if she doesn't live here anymore.

339	adjudicated	2	But I have been on about a dozen times, and have been hung up on nine. It is always the same issue, sadly. I get depressed, it is late, I cannot sleep or stop thinking about past trauma, and I would just like to talk to someone. But the bulk of them have hung up, some almost immediately, and some after longer. It is the longer ones that hurt more.
49	adjudicated	1	I already know more or less how i want the video to be, but i could use some help editing the video and tips for shooting it. The location is Helsinki, Finland. Would be ideal if someone with experience would reach out, perfect if he/she live nearby or we can make it work online. This is my first ever reddit post, hope to feel your love * <url>
490	adjudicated	2	So I met this girl last year, in November. Although we only dated officially for around a month, the feelings became very intense. Around the week before Christmas, she confessed she had been cheating on me with someone. At the time she was very distant towards me, and of course the cheating explained that. She and I met up last week to talk, I thought I would get closure but all I felt afterwards was a deep sense of regret.
477	adjudicated	4	The knowledge that a small part somewhere inside my dad was ...my dad. He was never able to defeat his demons. They destroyed his life and started waging battles in mine. I'll battle PTSD until my last breath. The thoughts, fears, and distorted reality is always hiding in your mind waiting for its chance.
396	adjudicated	2	My mother has always been a difficult person to talk with. She is extremely stubborn, and I have never seen her consider another person’s suggestion or opinion. She usually considers helpful advice or offers of assistance to be personal attacks. When having a conversation, she doesn’t listen to the other person, but only waits for her next turn to speak. She tends to obsess about a single topic and will refuse talk about anything else.

I need you to share my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pintrest, Tumblr and whatever other social media outlet you may use. Because the only way I can be successful at what I'm doing is to spread the message as far and wide as possible. TL;DR: I'm broke and live in a camper so I started a GoFundMe campaign because I need help to properly start up my business and I need you to share my campaign with all of your social networks.
110	adjudicated	1	I’m looking for work, mostly online jobs since I don’t have a car, but have also been applying for in person jobs and remote jobs, so I would need a phone for them to contact me. Would anyone be able to help me out? I can pay it back once I’ve got income again, and I can forward the confirmation to you to prove that it was paid. Or even if someone would be able to get me a cheap phone with some minutes on it, that would work too. Thank you for considering.
192	adjudicated	2	It was one week before the start of my second year of my bachelor’s degree. The first year was wonderful. The second, I was dead because of him… That night, we (my best friend (J), her boyfriend, and L) went to a party at N’s. I don’t really like to drink, so I stayed clear the whole time.
220	adjudicated	2	"- She left a youtube comment on one of my videos saying ""I have many ways of contacting you"". - She blamed me for the outburst, saying that if I just gave her what she wanted she wouldn't have to do this - She told me that ""the water dripping thing"" (nice diminishing statement of what she did) was a joke/prank - I threatened to call the police if she didn't stop - She angrily e-mailed one more time but then immediately became apologetic begging me to not contact the police"
316	adjudicated	2	But Kim Jong Un has already fired more missile than his dad and grandpa combined. How worried do I need to be on the East Coast of the USA? I'm trying to calm down with breathing exercises and busting my mind with Netflix. It's helping a bit, but I'm really on edge. I've got an appointment with my doctor next week, so I'm hoping maybe a higher dose of medicine can help.
245	adjudicated	3	(although i’m scared it’ll change me) TL;DR: I suffer from mental illness, and am leaving a relationship with my girlfriend. This is hard for me because she was the best and only friend I had and i’m in a very bad spot physically right now so i’m very isolated and lonely and in an unsafe place with my abusive father. I need to find someone to talk to because i’m hearing voices from an inanimate object and am becoming inseparable to it. how do I make friends whilst having my anxiety?
424	adjudicated	3	So im feeling a bit defeated; I finally went to my dr at the beginning of last month about my PPD and anxiety, also my workplace is very stressful and my marriage feels like it's crumbling because we are always arguing... my dr prescribed me Zoloft, I really wish now I had journaled how it made me feel, but thinking back, I had some nausea and then started to feel anxiety relief within a week, and overall better mood in a few weeks. Last week, I was working nights and forgot to take my Zoloft four days in a row... I went into a crisis/withdrawal, started taking it again and on day three I felt AWFUL. I went to a walkin because my dr was away that day. She prescribed me Paxil, to start at 10mg and then increase it to 20 after a week.
495	adjudicated	3	This is a long shot and kind of awkward to admit, but I'm a college student who lives 1500 miles away in Ohio. After months of looking for a job, I finally got one but not in time to pay my rent because of that I got a ton of fee's added to my rent for being late. I have been served an eviction and have pay over $1000 by august the 15th. While I have half of that I' am trying to pick up some web design clients--- I was a web designer before I went back to school. I also have experience being a virtual assistant.
132	adjudicated	2	That's the thing that really bothers me, not so much the act of sending one text, but sending one text doesn't make me feel done, it carries the weight of every other text I'll have to send. When I see someone's name come up on my caller ID I almost always get this flare of panic, and then just ignore it, even though I actually like chatting with my friends on the phone. It hardly ever even occurs to me to actually answer it (except family because they're equally uncommunicative so it's probably really important). Not an excuse, but I think I learned all of this -- especially my refusal to answer the phone -- from my parents, my mom more than my dad. They've don't stay in touch with people they aren't living in close proximity to, and they're pretty terrible at communicating consistently with us as well.
40	adjudicated	2	I’ve been sleeping in my car for 37 months with only 4 more months until I’m back on my feet. I’ve been staying in the same parking spot in the dark edge of a public parking lot every night. Last Thursday night I’m woken up by a cop banging on my window with his flashlight at 1:45am. He said he helped someone in the same parking lot a week prior find a place to live. I call bullshit on that.
461	adjudicated	3	I remember thinking “What the hell is he doing ?!”. This guy was so tall, so much heavier than me… He grabbed me, was on top of me, told me to “shut my fucking mouth right now”. I tried so hard to move, but I couldn’t… I remember him spitting on his dick, and then he penetrated me, his hand over my mouth. It was so violent, so painful. I can still feel the sweat on his cheek...
393	adjudicated	2	I feel like im receiving mixed signals from her as we usually talk for most of the day either thru texting or at work. (she chooses to sit by me everyday)   ---   **tl;dr**: How do I take things slow and not become clingy after not dating for a really long time? I really enjoyed getting to know her but I feel like im falling way too fast for this girl and Im not sure she feels the same way I do.
75	adjudicated	2	The last straw that broke me completely happened the night before/early morning of St Patty's day 2013 (age 21). I went to a bar for a pre-party. I had one shot with the bartender and some other guys there. I then started drinking water and talking to the guy sitting next to me. He said he was a pilot.
87	adjudicated	3	It's just us two and it's, really intense. She hugs me, tells me how much she's missed me. Reminisces about our relationship. Tells me how I broke her heart. She tells me about lads she's been with since and it felt like she was comparing them all to me and gets really emotional.
63	adjudicated	1	So I'm a student living off loans and part time work, he's a bank executive. We couldn't be at more different places in our lives, including when we met (again) back in Feb 2017. But we actually had a lot in common, including our sexuality -- both bi and both never formally dated a guy. We first met four years earlier when I was a security guard at the building he worked at. I noticed him right off the bat but was closeted at the time and never put much thought into him other than attraction, even when he became super friendly toward me.
326	adjudicated	3	I made some dumb decisions 1-2 years back. I took out some loans i shouldn't have, and i'm paying for it dearly now. I know it was dumb, but i don't feel like i deserve to starve for it, but thats just my opinion. On the other hand, i also know that i am not owed anything, and i am deeply ashamed of myself almost every day. Honestly, i am on a verge of a mental breakdown.
337	adjudicated	1	Hey guys, circumstances in my life has brought me to being homeless starting tomorrow. I live in Central Florida and the reason why I come to this position is due to my car breaking down, not being able to make it to work since its a 35 mile commute, and now that I can't pay rent, I have to leave the room I'm renting. Lately though Ive been thinking a lot of leaving to New York. I'll be homeless there, yes, but at least I'll be able to get around with 24/7 transportation. My question is: Is this a good idea?
11	adjudicated	3	"With the help of my therapist, I've come to somewhat of a revelation. I have a very hard time feeling a sense of accomplishment, especially for ""little"" things throughout the day. Obviously something like applying for a few jobs (I'm unemployed) isn't going to give anybody the same sense of accomplishment as something like earning a college degree. But I have a hard time not feeling like I should have applied for more, I'm still being lazy, a normal person would have done more, etc. Which in turn is making me feel like crap and leading me to apply for even less jobs and get less done."
351	adjudicated	1	Was looking at therapies for my gf and this stood out. Love any feedback from anyone who has used this. She's going to start Monday at 5 mg and go up from there. Here's a collection of studies on both prevention, various effects, and treatment benefits noted using hydrocortisone in people with PTSD or at high risk of it.
